This project looked at the expected survival time of different Game of Thrones characters. We explored whether survival probability varied by initial allegiances or if people who changed allegiances lasted longer. This project highlights survival curves, censored data, and statistical significance between different survival curves. Take a look at our [presentation!](DATA599_GROUPPROJECT1_HALL_SMITH_ROMERO.pdf)
