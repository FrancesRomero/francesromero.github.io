Mushroom Edibility:

This project utilized machine learning to predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their descriptions. Implemented in Python, the project involved feature selection, model selection, model training and evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. The techniques used included K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a comparison of models such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, and ensemble learning.
