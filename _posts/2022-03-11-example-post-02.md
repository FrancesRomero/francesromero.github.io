Customer Churn At Telco:

This project used survival analysis to answer a question that was not actually related to “death”, but instead whether or not a customer maintained their telecommunications services at Telco. We explored how different contract types affected customer churn rates and whether families demonstrated a different churn behavior than individual customers within these different contract types. Additions to this survival analysis project were feature selection using Z scores and optimizing model selection using AIC. Check out our presentation [here!](/assets/Project2 Presentation.pdf)
