## Bio

Welcome to my page! 

I'm Frances Romero, a data scientist based in Portland, Oregon. I earned my bachelor's degree in biology and environmental science from Bryn Mawr College, where I discovered my passion for coding while analyzing ecological data using R.

After my undergraduate studies, I enrolled in Willamette University’s master's program in data science, and I’m set to graduate in August 2024. Currently, I work as a sales data analyst for Trimble Inc., a software company headquartered in Westminster, Colorado. My work involves leveraging tools like R, Python, SQL, and DOMO to drive data-driven decision-making.

I'm particularly interested in applying my data science skills to work for the Department of Education. In my free time, I enjoy playing roller derby with the Rose City Rollers.
